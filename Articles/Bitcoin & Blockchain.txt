Bitcoin could hit $100,000 in 10 years, says the analyst who correctly called its $2,000 price
Bitcoin could make up 10 percent of the $5 trillion average daily volume in the foreign exchange market in 10 years, 
according to Saxo Bank analyst Kay Van-Petersen.
Its market capitalization could grow to $1.75 trillion which would make each bitcoin worth $100,000.
A few factors will boost bitcoin adoption including better wallets, easier methods to buy the digital currency, 
use of it for money transfers in areas like remittances, 
as well as citizens of countries with volatile economies and currencies buying it


Michael Robinson  suggests that the strong correction we saw in early December, 
coupled with the consistent support of the 50 day moving average, indicates Bitcoin is an extremely healthy market, 
and should only continue to increase in value.

just as the internet has since changed the world, digital currency experts believe their technology will transform society,
 meaning bitcoin may just be getting started, and this time is not the same.

Here are three reasons why:

1. Higher prices add value to the digital currency system.
2. More people, including financial institutions, want to buy bitcoin.
3. The real world finds more ways to use bitcoin.


Blockchain finally penetrated the mainstream consciousness in 2016, 
moving away from its reputation simply as the technology behind Bitcoin and cementing itself as its own,
 incredibly disruptive, entity.

Blockchain has the potential to transform industry operating models.
 However, while noise around the distributed ledger technology grew steadily throughout the year, 
the majority of companies are still stuck in the exploration phase, 
beguiled by its beauty but unable to translate this fascination into practical applications
